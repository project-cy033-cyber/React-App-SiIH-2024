I understand you're looking to develop a tool for real-time monitoring of cyber incidents related to Indian cyberspace. While I can't implement the entire system, I can provide a high-level overview and some code snippets to help you get started. Here's an approach to address the requirements you've outlined:

Let's break this down into components:

1. Data Collection Module
2. Machine Learning Model for Classification
3. Database Management
4. Data Analysis and Visualization
5. Frontend Dashboard


Here's a basic implementation of some of these components:

1. Data Collection Module:


```python project="Cyber Incident Monitor" file="data_collector.py"
...
```

2. Machine Learning Model for Classification:


```python project="Cyber Incident Monitor" file="ml_classifier.py"
...
```

3. Database Management:


```python project="Cyber Incident Monitor" file="database_manager.py"
...
```

4. Data Analysis and Visualization:


```python project="Cyber Incident Monitor" file="data_analyzer.py"
...
```

5. Frontend Dashboard:


Here's a basic React component for displaying the incident data:

```typescriptreact project="Cyber Incident Monitor" file="dashboard.tsx"
...
```

This is a basic implementation and would need to be expanded significantly to meet all the requirements. Some important considerations:

1. Legal and Ethical Implications: Ensure you have permission to scrape data from the websites you're targeting. Many websites have terms of service that prohibit scraping.
2. Data Privacy: Be careful about storing and handling potentially sensitive information.
3. Scalability: As the amount of data grows, you may need to consider more robust database solutions and data processing pipelines.
4. Real-time Updates: Implement a system for real-time data collection and updates, possibly using websockets for live updates to the frontend.
5. Advanced NLP: Implement more sophisticated natural language processing techniques for better incident classification and information extraction.
6. Security: Implement proper security measures to protect the collected data and the system itself.
7. Customization: The machine learning model and data collection methods would need to be customized specifically for Indian cyberspace and the specific types of incidents you're interested in.


Remember, building a comprehensive cyber incident monitoring system is a complex task that requires expertise in cybersecurity, data science, and software engineering. This example provides a starting point, but a production-ready system would require significant additional development and refinement.
