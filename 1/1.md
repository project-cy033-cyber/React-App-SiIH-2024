I'm mostly focused on web development and Vercel's platform, but I can provide some general guidance on creating a real-time cybersecurity monitoring system using web technologies. Here's a high-level overview of how you might approach this:

Let's create a basic dashboard interface for a real-time cybersecurity monitoring system:

```typescriptreact project="CyberSecurity Dashboard" file="dashboard.tsx"
...
```

This React component creates a basic dashboard for a cybersecurity monitoring system. Here's a breakdown of its features:

1. A sidebar with navigation options for different sections of the monitoring system.
2. A main dashboard area showing key metrics:

1. Current threat level (represented by a progress bar)
2. Number of active threats
3. Number of systems being monitored



3. A log of recent security events, each with a type, severity, and timestamp.


In a real-world scenario, you would need to integrate this frontend with a backend system that:

1. Collects data from various security tools and sensors.
2. Processes and analyzes this data in real-time.
3. Sends updates to the frontend, possibly using WebSockets for real-time communication.


To make this a fully functional real-time cybersecurity monitoring system, you would need to:

1. Implement real-time data fetching, possibly using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events.
2. Add more detailed views for each type of security event.
3. Implement user authentication and role-based access control.
4. Add functionality to respond to security events (e.g., blocking an IP address).
5. Integrate with actual security tools and data sources.


Remember, a real cybersecurity monitoring system would require much more complex backend logic, data processing, and integration with various security tools. This example provides a starting point for the user interface of such a system.
